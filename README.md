# Banking_case_Dashboard
# Banking Customer Analytics ðŸ“Š

This project explores a synthetic banking dataset using **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**. It includes full-cycle data analysisâ€”from ingestion and cleaning to visualizationâ€”aimed at uncovering customer behavior and financial patterns.

---

## Tools Used
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** â€“ for data cleaning and EDA.
- **MySQL** â€“ to store and manage structured banking data.
- **Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)** â€“ for coding and analysis (`banking_case1.ipynb`).
- **Power BI** â€“ to build an interactive dashboard (`Banking_dashboard.pbit`).

---

##  Files Included
- `Banking.csv` â€“ The main dataset.
- `banking_case1.ipynb` â€“ Python notebook with cleaning, SQL connection, and EDA.
- `Banking_dashboard.pbit` â€“ Power BI dashboard file.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python package list.

##  Key Insights from the Project

-  **Younger customers (age 20â€“35)** tend to have **fewer loans** and **higher deposit ratios**, but lower credit card balances.
-  **Platinum loyalty customers** have the **highest average income and property ownership**, indicating a high-value segment.
-  A **strong correlation** exists between `Estimated Income` and `Bank Deposits`, but not with credit card balances.
-  Occupation type significantly affects customer wealthâ€”**Consultants and Executives** are top tiers in deposits.
-  **Risk Weighting** increases with the number of products held, especially loans and credit cards.

These findings were visualized using Power BI for better understanding by stakeholders.

##  How to Run
1. Load `Banking.csv` into MySQL (optional â€“ can use directly in notebook).
2. Run `banking_case1.ipynb` to explore, clean, and analyze the data.
3. Open `Banking_dashboard.pbit` in Power BI and connect to MySQL or CSV.
4. Refresh visuals to explore customer behavior dynamically.
